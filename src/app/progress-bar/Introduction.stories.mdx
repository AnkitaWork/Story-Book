# Welcome to [**Progress Bar**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/)

Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes. We donâ€™t use the HTML5 element, ensuring you can stack progress bars, animate them, and place text labels over them.

We use the .progress as a wrapper to indicate the max value of the progress bar.

We use the inner .progress-bar to indicate the progress so far.

The .progress-bar requires an inline style, utility class, or custom CSS to set their width.

The .progress-bar also requires some role and aria attributes to make it accessible.
